    <p><i>
        <h2>Description:</h2>


        
        Embark on a journey through time and heritage as we delve into the rich history and architectural splendor of Shaniwar Wada, a magnificent palace nestled in the heart of Pune, Maharashtra, India. Built in the 18th century by the Peshwa rulers of the Maratha Empire, Shaniwar Wada stands as a testament to the grandeur and opulence of the era.
        
        Intricately designed and fortified, Shaniwar Wada served as the seat of the Peshwa dynasty and witnessed the unfolding of significant historical events. Its sprawling complex, adorned with majestic gates, intricate carvings, and sprawling gardens, reflects the grandeur and architectural brilliance of the Maratha period.
        <br><br>
        <b> SHANIWAR WADA LOCATION:</b><br>
        Shaniwar Wada is located in Shaniwar Peth, Pune, a central area that reflects Pune's historical and cultural heritage. The fort's strategic location and architectural grandeur continue to attract visitors from across the globe, offering a glimpse into Pune's illustrious past.
        <br><br>
        <b>SHANIWAR WADA HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE:</b><br>
        Shaniwar Wada was a grand palace built by a powerful leader named Peshwa Baji Rao I in Pune, India, back in 1730. Initially, it was supposed to be a huge seven-story stone palace, but due to some rules, only the base floor could be built with stones. The rest was made of bricks. Over time, the Peshwas added more features like walls, gates, and fountains to the palace.
        
        The palace was witness to many important events. In 1773, one of the Peshwas, Narayan Rao, was murdered here. It's also famous for the love story of Peshwa Bajirao and Mastani.
        
        In 1818, the British took over the palace after winning a war. Later, in 1828, a big fire destroyed much of the palace, leaving only some parts standing. Today, what remains of the palace is a tourist attraction where people can see its history and grandeur.
        <br><br>
       <b> SHANIWAR WADA ARCHITECTURE MARVEL:</b><br>
        Shaniwar Wada is a remarkable example of Maratha Imperial architecture. It was constructed using materials like teak, lime, and stone from various sources. The fortification wall of the palace had five entry points and nine bastion towers, making it well-defended.
        
        Inside, the palace boasted intricately carved teak doorways, beautifully designed teak pillars, and marble floors. Its walls were adorned with scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata, while elegant glass chandeliers hung from the ceilings.
        
        Within the palace complex, there was the Ganpati Rang Mahal, a special place for religious ceremonies, featuring a massive statue of Lord Ganesha.
        
        A highlight of the palace was the Hazari Karanje, or the Fountain of a Thousand Jets, shaped like a lotus. It was known for its grandeur, with jets reaching up to 80 feet high, making it one of the most exquisite fountains of its time.
        
        Other notable structures within the palace included the Thorlya Rayancha Diwankhana (the court reception hall of Baji Rao I), the Juna Arsa Mahal (Mirror Hall), and the Naachacha Diwankhana (Dance Hall), all showcasing the opulence and grandeur of the Maratha Empire.
        <br><br>
        <b>SHANIWAR WADA PRESENT CHARMS:</b><br>
        Despite being a ruin, Shaniwar Wada remains a popular attraction in Pune, covering a vast area of 625 acres. Its historical significance draws visitors from all over.
        
        Interestingly, Shaniwar Wada is also known as one of the most haunted places in Pune. Legend has it that the spirit of Peshwa Narayan Rao, who was murdered within its walls, still wanders the palace grounds at night. The evening light and sound show held here adds to the allure for tourists.
        
        Shaniwar Wada's influence extends beyond its physical boundaries, shaping the layout of the old part of Pune. The surrounding area features some of the city's oldest markets, such as Tulshibaug, Laxmi Road, and Ravivar Peth, offering a glimpse into Pune's rich heritage and bustling culture.</i></p>
