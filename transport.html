        - Zones and Regulations: Auto-rickshaws are widely available across Pune, particularly in busy areas and near transit hubs. The city’s regulations help maintain fair pricing and passenger safety, making autos a reliable choice for short trips and city exploration.</p>  <br> <br>

    - Booking and Costs: Reserve your car online or at the rental office with a valid driver’s license, ID, and a credit/debit card for the deposit.
